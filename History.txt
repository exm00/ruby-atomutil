== 0.0.7 2008-08-29

* bugfix: fix where it checks the response code is OK or No Content when updating resource.
          fix Element::to_s because last version of REXML::Document::to_s doesn't accept any param.

== 0.0.6 2008-05-01

Removed dependency on REXML::Formatters::Pretty,
because REXML::Formatters::Pretty inserts linebreaks into each tags...
But this isn't best solution.

== 0.0.5 2008-04-30

* bugfix: Atom::Content didn't work as expected with multibyte UTF-8 string.
          Atom::Element::to_s didn't work well on ruby 1.8.6 or above, because
          REXML::Document::to_s is deprecated and has a bug on 1.8.6 or 1.9 patched release.
          require 'sha1' -> require 'digest/sha1'

Thanks to walf443, Elton Okada.
